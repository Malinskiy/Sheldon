# Sheldon
Key concepts:

* Preferences **should not be tied to concrete implementation**, they should be an interface 
 that you can easily mock in your tests
* You should be able to provide **implementation gateway** in your platform layer
* Get your values through **RxJava's Observable**
* Get rid of always specifying a string key when you get or set preference, this should be **strongly typed**
 so that your IDE can help with autocompletion and your key<->value pair is always in sync
* Leverage annotation processing to **automatically generate the wiring code** between your preferences and platform gateway 
 
# Define your interface:

```java
@Preferences(name = "temp")
public interface SomePreferences {
    @Default(name = "name") String DEFAULT_VALUE = "DEFAULT_VALUE";
    @Get(name = "name") Observable<String> getValueName();
    @Set(name = "name") void setValue(String newValue);
    ...
    @Contains Obsrvable<Boolean> contains(String key);
    @Delete void remove(String key);
}
```

# Adapters
Natively supported types are *Boolean*, *Float*, *Integer*, *Long* and *String*.
 
For everything else you have to extend **IPreferenceAdapter** and implement storing your
entity via supported types. You can look at example of generic **EnumAdapter**.
To include your adapter into processing just annotate it with **@Adapter**.

**Each adapter should have a no-args constructor**

# Defaults
For each parameter you have to **always supply a default value** as a field in an interface annotated with **@Default**.
Type of parameter should be the same as in getter and setter.

# Instantiate the generated implementation
```java
Temp_Preferences preferences = new Temp_Preferences(new SharedPreferencesGatewayBuilder(contextRef));
```

Probably you'd store this in your dependency graph and inject it by interface
For additional info look at the sample

## Get it

Gradle:
```groovy
repositories {
    ...
    mavenCentral()
    ...
}
...
dependencies {
    ...
    apt "com.malinskiy.sheldon:compiler:$version"
    compile "com.malinskiy.sheldon:core:$version"
    compile "com.malinskiy.sheldon:gateway-sharedpreferences:$version"
    ...
}
```
